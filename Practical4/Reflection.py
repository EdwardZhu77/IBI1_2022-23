In practical 4 I learned how to use git command to set up a working branch and make changes to the branch content on the local computer. It is a little bit difficult for beginer like me.

In the process of git practice, I think it is difficult to make clear that where you actually are.

In the process of building web pages, I think the more difficult is how to change the style.

In the whole IBI, I found it is a little bit difficult for me :(
