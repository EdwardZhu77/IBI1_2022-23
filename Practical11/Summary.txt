What we find:

When comparing the alignment scores and proportion of matching amino acids, the human ACE2 protein sequence had the strongest similarity with the cat ACE2 sequence. 
Out of all the comparisons, the human and feline ACE2 sequences had the maximum level of sequence identity at 85.217% and the highest alignment score of 3717.
Evolutionarily, humans and cats likely shared a more recent common ancestor than humans and mice. 
The higher conservation of ACE2 sequences in humans and cats suggests stronger pressure to maintain similar ACE2 functions. 
In contrast, humans and mice diverged earlier, allowing more changes in their ACE2 genes over time.
In summary, ACE2 sequence comparisons suggest humans and cats are more closely related than humans and mice. 
Greater sequence similarity between human and cat ACE2 indicates a more recent common ancestor and potentially greater functional constraints on ACE2 in these animals. 
These results provide insights into evolutionary relationships and the importance of preserving certain ACE2 functions across these mammals.
